DeFi 是什么？有哪些值得关注的经济信息？ - 知乎 DeFi 是什么？有哪些值得关注的经济信息？ - 知乎 Image 1) ​  DeFi 是什么？有哪些值得关注的经济信息？ 去中心化 DeFi 是什么？有哪些值得关注的经济信息？ Image 2: 量化踩坑指南 ​ 关注 ​收藏​喜欢 收起​ Image 4: 螃蟹哥炒现货 ​ 关注 DeFi 是 Decentralized Finance 的缩写，中文称为 “去中心化金融”，是以比特币和以太币为代表的加密货币、区块链和智能合约结合的产物3。它是建立在区块链之上的去中心化金融应用生态系统，实际是一组新兴的金融产品和服务，这些产品和服务在去中心化平台上运行，并使用区块链技术记录和共享数据。 *   **去中心化**：去除了第三方机构及中介这样的中间人角色，交易双方直接连接进行金融交易，如转账、理财、货币兑换、借贷、抵押等，避免了因繁杂的中间环节而导致金钱成本和时间成本的浪费。同时，基于区块链技术形成的金融体系，不受控于任何一个实体或机构，其点对点网络系统能够实现个人账户对个人账户的即时转账、汇款等金融交易，只需要提供个人钱包地址，无需中间机构的流转，便可实现即时交易。而且在智能合约的控制和保护下，交易双方无需提供个人隐私数据便可完成交易。 *   **开放性**：一方面其智能合约代码是开源的，可供人们查询监督；另一方面，基于 DeFi 的交易，除了交易各方的私有信息被加密外，其交易数据对所有人公开，任何人都可以通过公开的接口查询区块链数据和开发相关应用，而在其系统产生的所有交易记录和交易行为也均是可查可溯的。因此整个系统高度透明开放。 DeFi 的主要应用场景包括借贷（如 Aave、Compound 等借贷协议）、稳定币（如 DAI 等）、去中心化交易所（如 Uniswap 等）、衍生品交易等。 在关注 DeFi 相关的经济信息时，以下方面值得留意： *   **市场规模和增长趋势**：了解 DeFi 整体市场的规模大小，以及其在不同时间段的增长或收缩情况，这能反映出 DeFi 行业的发展态势和受关注程度。 *   **主流项目的发展动态**：像 MakerDAO、Compound 等知名 DeFi 项目的业务进展、用户数量、资金量变化等信息，它们的表现往往对整个 DeFi 领域有重要影响。例如 MakerDAO 在应对市场波动时对抵押品机制的调整等举措，会影响其稳定币的稳定性和市场信心3。 *   **监管政策的变化**：各国政府对于 DeFi 的监管态度和政策不断演变，监管政策的收紧或放松会对 DeFi 的发展产生重大影响。比如某些国家对加密货币交易和相关金融活动的监管规定，可能会限制 DeFi 在当地的发展，或者促使 DeFi 项目进行合规调整。 *   **安全事件**：由于 DeFi 建立在区块链技术之上，智能合约的安全性至关重要。安全漏洞导致的黑客攻击事件会影响用户对 DeFi 的信任和参与度，同时也促使行业更加重视安全问题并推动安全技术的发展。例如 2020 年 2 - 3 月，DeFi 领域就出现了 6 起安全事件，损失超过 150 万美元。 *   **与传统金融的融合与竞争**：关注 DeFi 与传统金融体系之间的互动，例如传统金融机构对 DeFi 的参与或合作，以及 DeFi 对传统金融业务模式的挑战和影响。这有助于理解 DeFi 在整个金融领域中的地位和未来发展方向。 ​收藏​喜欢 Image 5: 知乎用户 defi 去中心化金融。 ​收藏​喜欢 收起​ Image 8: QR Code of Downloading Zhihu App 下载知乎客户端 与世界分享知识、经验和见解 Image 9: 本站提供适老化无障碍服务,Positive,https://www.zhihu.com/question/660773441

"What Is DeFi? The 2025 Guide to Decentralized Finance * **Definition:** DeFi (Decentralized Finance) replaces centralized intermediaries like banks with autonomous code (smart contracts) on a blockchain. * **Core Benefits:** DeFi enables 24/7 lending, trading, and asset management with near-instant settlement and self-custody. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeFi rebuilds financial instruments—from lending and borrowing to trading and derivatives—as open, programmable software. * **DeFi is like Email:** You simply hit ""send."" The underlying protocol (like SMTP for email, or a Smart Contract for DeFi) handles the delivery instantly, globally, and automatically, 24/7. 3. **Execution:** The smart contract receives your assets and adds them to a ""liquidity pool"" (a digital pile of funds available for others to borrow). This allows DeFi users to earn stable, government-backed yields and gives institutions access to global liquidity. Today, we are entering the High-Performance Era. New infrastructure allows DeFi to operate at the speed of the internet, with sub-second finality.

"4 Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Dropped Below $90,000 Again # Why Did Bitcoin Drop Below $90,000 Again? * Bitcoin dropped under $90,000 due to mass long liquidations and thin market liquidity. * PCE data eased panic slightly, but future rate policy will define Bitcoin’s next move. **Bitcoin slipped under $90,000 this week as liquidation pressure, weak ETF demand, and macro uncertainty converged.**. ## Forced Liquidations Across the Market. Traders also derisked ahead of the US PCE inflation release, forcing Bitcoin into a cautious $91,000–$95,000 holding pattern. Market analysts largely blamed excess leverage, thin liquidity, and macro-hedging rather than coordinated price intervention.

The immediate market reaction has been a mix of cautious optimism and renewed bullish sentiment, with significant institutional capital flowing into the ecosystem, particularly through Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).

"JPMorgan says Strategy's resilience is key to bitcoin 's price directio... The decline in hashrate and mining difficulty reflects two forces, the analysts said: China [reiterating](https://www.theblock.co/post/380811/chinas-central-bank-reaffirms-crypto-ban-flags-stablecoin-risks-following-multi-agency-meeting) its ban on bitcoin mining after a surge in private mining activity, and high-cost miners outside China retreating as lower prices and elevated energy costs squeeze profitability.
